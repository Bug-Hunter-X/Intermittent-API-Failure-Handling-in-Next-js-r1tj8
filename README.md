# Next.js API Error Handling

This repository demonstrates a common issue in Next.js applications: handling intermittent failures when fetching data from an API route.  The application fetches data, but the API route simulates occasional failures. The initial implementation doesn't handle these failures gracefully, resulting in a poor user experience.

The `bug.js` file shows the problematic code. The solution, provided in `bugSolution.js`, demonstrates how to correctly handle API errors, providing the user with informative feedback and preventing crashes.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Start the development server: `npm run dev`
4. Observe the behavior of the application â€“ it will sometimes display an error, sometimes work correctly.

## Solution

The solution addresses the issue by using error handling within the `useEffect` hook. This approach ensures that if the API call fails, a user-friendly message is displayed instead of an error.
